<h3>Simon Jarret</h3>
<p>An ordinary man thrust into extraordinary circumstances. After surviving a traumatic brain injury, Simon volunteers for an experimental scan meant to help his recovery—only to awaken in a nightmarish underwater facility long after humanity's fall. Confused and desperate for answers, he's forced to confront not only the horrors around him, but the unsettling truth of his own existence.</p>

<h3>Catherine Chun</h3>
<p>A brilliant and determined scientist from PATHOS-II, Catherine is one of the minds behind the ARK project—a desperate attempt to preserve humanity's legacy in digital form. Practical, intelligent, and driven by hope, she serves as both guide and moral compass to Simon, though her calm rationality often hides the emotional weight of her choices.</p>

<h3>David Munshi</h3>
<p>A young neuroscientist and researcher dedicated to experimental brain mapping. Driven by curiosity and compassion, he develops a cutting-edge scan procedure to help patients with brain trauma—unaware that his small experiment will have consequences far beyond his lifetime. His work becomes the unlikely spark that sets SOMA's haunting chain of events in motion.</p>
